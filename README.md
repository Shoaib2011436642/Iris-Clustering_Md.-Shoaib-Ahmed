# Iris Clustering – Unsupervised Learning


## Project Overview
This project applies **unsupervised clustering algorithms** to group flowers in the classic Iris dataset based on their physical features (sepal & petal length/width).

## Purpose
- To understand how clustering works without labeled data.
- To visually compare clustering results with actual species.
- To evaluate clustering performance using silhouette scores and dendrograms.

## Real-World Importance
Clustering has broad applications in:
- Customer segmentation
- Image & document grouping
- Bioinformatics
- Anomaly detection

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Cluster visualizations
- `scikit-learn` – Clustering models, evaluation metrics

## Models Used
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)
- DBSCAN

## Visualizations & Metrics
- Pairplots with true labels
- Clustering scatter plots
- Dendrogram (Hierarchical)
- Silhouette Score for cluster quality
- Comparison of predicted clusters vs actual species

## Expected Outcomes
- Visually distinct clusters for Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
- Better understanding of the strengths/limitations of each clustering method.
- Demonstration of how unsupervised learning can uncover patterns in unlabeled data.
